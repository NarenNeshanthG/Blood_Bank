    <h3>Why Donate Blood?</h3>
    <p>Blood donation is a critical service supporting surgeries, cancer treatments, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries. A single donation can help save up to three lives.</p>

    <h3>Basic Eligibility Guidelines</h3>
    <p>While our AI provides a specific prediction, general requirements include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Age: Typically 18-65 years old.</li>
        <li>Weight: Minimum 50 kg (110 lbs).</li>
        <li>Health: Good general health, feeling well on the day of donation.</li>
        <li>Hemoglobin: Minimum levels apply (checked before donation).</li>
        <li>Donation Interval: Usually 56 days (8 weeks) since last whole blood donation.</li>
        <li>Risk Factors: No recent high-risk behaviors, travel to certain areas, specific medical conditions, or certain medications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note: Our registration form asks detailed questions used by the prediction model. Always be honest about your health history.</em></p>
